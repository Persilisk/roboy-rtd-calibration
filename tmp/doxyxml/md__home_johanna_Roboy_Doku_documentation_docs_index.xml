    <title>Tendon-driven Robots</title>
    <detaileddescription>
<para>The Roboy team works on tendon-driven robots. These motors don&apos;t move the robot directy, but pull a cord, which translates the motion onto the robot parts. This tendon is attached to a spring, which adds more flexibility to the system and makes its behaviour more human-like.</para><para><image type="html" name="Motor1.jpg"></image>
</para><para>When a robot is started, it loses all knowledge about its motor positions. Therefore only relative positions are transmitted, the robot doesn&apos;t know the current absolute pose of its parts.</para><para>This shows the need for calibration: A calibration procedure can discover the motion limits and set the robot into a standartized initial pose. The absolute values can be translated into relative ones.</para><para>The big picture is to have a calibration program for Roboy 2.0. But as Roboy 2.0 doesn&apos;t exist yet, we have to start with the PaBiLegs. The motors only move in a 2-dimensional space, which makes it easier to calibrate.</para><para><heading level="1">Why is there no calibration improvement for Roboy 1.0?</heading>
</para><para>Roboy 1.0 does not use ROS and misses joint angle sensors, which makes the implementation very complicated. It is more reasonable to focus on the newer robots, like i.e. PaBiLegs. </para>    </detaileddescription>
